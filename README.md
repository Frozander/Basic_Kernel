# Basic Kernel Project
It has OS in its name, even though it is just a crappy kernel.  
Deal with it.

## Building
Needs a cross-compiler.  
Makefile uses gcc so you need to compile latest *binutils* and *gcc* for i686 target.  
Just call "make" to build and call "clean" to remove output files.

## What it does?
Pretty much nothing. The kernel only has basic ASCII text and VGA textmode colours.
